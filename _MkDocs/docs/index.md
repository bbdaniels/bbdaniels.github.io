[Benjamin Daniels](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bExwzN4AAAAJ&hl=en) is a Research Analyst in the Development Research Group (Human Development and Impact Evaluation teams) at the World Bank. Benjaminâ€™s research focuses on the delivery of high-quality primary health care in developing contexts. His work has highlighted the importance of direct measurement of health care provider knowledge, effort, and practice. To that end, he has supported some the largest research studies to date utilizing clinical vignettes, provider observation, and standardized patients. Benjamin works with the [QuTUB Project](https://www.qutubproject.org/).

## Research Reproducibility and Best Practices

Benjamin works with [DIME Analytics](http://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/DIME-Analytics) to create tools that improve the quality and reproducibility of development research. There, he supports best practices in econometrics, statistical programming, and research reproducibility across the i2i portfolio. This work comprises code and process development, research personnel training, and direct support for data analysis and survey development. These tools include software products like the [World Bank Stata GitHub](http://worldbank.github.io/stata/), [`ietoolkit`](http://worldbank.github.io/ietoolkit/), and research resources like the [DIME Wiki](http://dimewiki.worldbank.org).

Benjamin\u2019s research focuses on the delivery of high-quality primary health care in developing contexts. His work has highlighted the importance of direct measurement of health care provider knowledge, effort, and practice. To that end, he has supported some the largest research studies to date utilizing clinical vignettes, provider observation, and standardized patients. Benjamin also specializes in research methods as a part of the DIME Analytics team. There, he supports best practices in econometrics, statistical programming, and research reproducibility across the i2i portfolio. This work comprises code and process development, research personnel training, and direct support for data analysis and survey development. Quality of Care Research Benjamin works with the QuTUB Project . Research Reproducibility and Best Practices Benjamin also works with DIME Analytics to create tools that improve the quality and reproducibility of development research. These tools include software products like the World Bank Stata GitHub , ietoolkit , and research resources like the DIME Wiki . Academic Work Variations in the quality of tuberculosis care in urban India: A cross-sectional, standardized patient study in two cities ( Plos Medicine | GitHub ) Use of standardised patients to assess quality of healthcare in Nairobi, Kenya: a pilot, cross-sectional study with international comparisons ( BMJ Global Health | GitHub ) Use of standardised patients to assess quality of tuberculosis care: a pilot, cross-sectional study ( The Lancet Infectious Diseases | GitHub ) Use of standardised patients to assess antibiotic dispensing for tuberculosis by pharmacies in urban India: a cross-sectional study ( The Lancet Infectious Diseases | GitHub ) Social equity issues in the distribution of feed-in tariff policy benefits: A cross sectional analysis from England and Wales using spatial census and policy data ( Energy Policy ) Examining the quality of medicines at Kenyan healthcare facilities: a validation of an alternative post-market surveillance model that uses standardized patients ( Drugs - Real World Outcomes ) Human Capital Accumulation and Disasters: Evidence from the Pakistan Earthquake of 2005 ( NEUDC 2018 ) Stata Code betterbar : Stata module to produce bar graphs with optional standard error bars and cross-group comparisons dta2kml : Stata module to output a KML file from selected datapoints in a Stata dataset crossfold : Stata module to perform k-fold cross-validation","title":"About"},{"location":"#about","text":"Benjamin Daniels is a Research Analyst in the Development Research Group (Human Development and Impact Evaluation teams) at the World Bank.

Finally, crossfold reports a measure of goodness-of-fit from each attempt. The default evaluation metric is root mean squared error (RMSE).
